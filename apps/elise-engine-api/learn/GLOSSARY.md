# elise-engine-api Glossary

The words used in this MVP. Use these words in code comments, tickets, and lessons.

## Parts

**Scan**:
One run that clones a repo, audits it with the agent, and saves a report.
_Avoid_: Job, task, run (when you mean the whole thing)

**Scan ID**:
A random UUID that names one scan and its sandbox, and is the folder name in the R2 bucket.
_Avoid_: Job ID, request ID

**Worker**:
The Cloudflare program in `src/index.ts` that receives HTTP requests and starts scans.
_Avoid_: Server, backend, API

**Sandbox**:
One Durable Object plus the container it starts, used for exactly one scan (class `ScanSandbox`).
_Avoid_: VM, box

**Durable Object**:
A named Cloudflare object with its own storage that controls the container for one scan.
_Avoid_: Actor, session

**Container**:
A Linux machine that starts from the image and runs the agent.
_Avoid_: Docker, VM, pod

**Image**:
The frozen file system a container starts from, built from the Dockerfile.
_Avoid_: Docker image (say "image"), snapshot

**Instance type**:
The size of a container: vCPU, memory, and disk. We use `standard-1`.
_Avoid_: Plan, tier

**R2 bucket**:
The Cloudflare storage that holds each scan's saved files.
_Avoid_: Database, S3

## The agent

**Agent**:
The Claude Code program that runs inside the container and reads the repo.
_Avoid_: Bot, AI

**Skill**:
A folder of written instructions the agent follows. We have `lite` and `full`.
_Avoid_: Prompt, plugin

**Report**:
The `REPORT.md` file the agent writes for people to read.
_Avoid_: Output, result

**Finding**:
One security problem in `findings.json`, with a status of `confirmed` or `needs_validation`.
_Avoid_: Bug, issue, vulnerability (until a person checks it)

**Detached run**:
Starting the agent in the background with its output in files, then polling for its exit code.
_Avoid_: Async run

## Safety and cost

**Outbound handler**:
Worker code that sees every network request the container makes and decides to block it or pass it on.
_Avoid_: Proxy, firewall

**Allowlist**:
The short list of hosts the container may reach: `github.com` and `api.anthropic.com`.
_Avoid_: Whitelist

**Secret**:
A value stored in the Worker, not in git, such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `SCAN_API_TOKEN`.
_Avoid_: Env var (an env var is not always secret)

**Budget cap**:
The most dollars the agent may spend in one scan (`--max-budget-usd`). The ceiling is `MAX_BUDGET_USD`.
_Avoid_: Limit, quota

**Effort**:
How hard the agent thinks: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`.
_Avoid_: Quality, depth

## Ambiguities

- "Sandbox" means the Durable Object and the container together. "Container" means the Linux machine only.
- A finding is not a confirmed vulnerability until a person checks it.
